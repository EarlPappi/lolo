      <h1>To my woman forever</h1>

      <p>
       To Mofiyifoluwa, <br> <br>
       
       I wrote every lines of this piece with tears, punched every key of this calculator with a very heavy heart. To start with, let me remind you of who you are! You are a beacon of hope, a lighthouse on a stormy sea, you're my sunshine and you're my God. The woamna I want to spend the rest of my life with. You smile brightens my world, my world eveolves around you. Yes, I am to flawed to possess the rarest of gem like you, every day and passing moments, I bless the name of the Lord for making making our star cross. <br> <br>

       You did no evil by trusting me, for allowing a 'useless' being like me into your life, I betrayed your trust in me, stabbed you in the back while all you wanted for me is the best. <br><br>

       I miss you, I miss being able to call you and hear your voice and not the automated "The user you're trying to call is busy" message, I miss hearing you call my name, I miss the times I pray to God for a better day, now a better day is when I receive your text in my DM, I miss you and every second without you makes me want to die. You are my God. <br> <br>

       I'm sorry for everything, for breaking every iota of trust you had in me. I am sorry for introducing my mum to her daughter-in-law this way, I am totally sorry. I'm sorry I got you embarassed, I am sorry for the pain I caused you, I am sorry for everything. I realized my flaws, I realized my shortcomings, I realized my misdeed, I know better now and I will surely do better. <br> <br>

       With the way I crave food every minute, I never really believe I could go over a day and half without food, but somehow I did. I cried my heart to God for forgiveness, He did forgave me but you are my God. <br> <br>

       Mofiyifoluwa, you are the woman I want to send the rest of my life with, I will treat you right, grow with you, I swear on God never to leave your side
